description: Part 1 The Dream's Betrayal
---

S sat alone in his dimly lit room, the pages of his journal staring back at him, blank and empty. He yearned to weave a story, a tale of love and longing that had haunted his dreams. With determination in his eyes, he grasped his pen and began to write, using the power of words to bring his dream to life. The dream revolved around S and his love for C. They were inseparable, deeply connected by an unbreakable bond. Their love was pure and true, something that others envied. But there was one person who despised their happiness, someone who wanted to tear them apart.

_"In the realm of dreams, love knows no bounds,"_ he mused, his mind filled with the image of a protagonist named S, a soul deeply entwined with a woman named C. Their love burned fiercely, casting a glow that others coveted. Yet, amidst the warmth, a shadow emerged, seeking to extinguish their flame. This mysterious figure, the antagonist of the dream, was determined to ruin S and C's love. They would try everything in their power to sabotage their relationship, but no matter what they did, S and C's love always prevailed. It was as if their love had a force of its own, protecting them from harm.

_"Love is a battlefield, and not all fights are fair,"_ he wrote, envisioning the relentless efforts of an unknown adversary, determined to tear apart S and C's bond. No matter the hurdles thrown in their path, their love prevailed, resilient and unyielding.

Amidst the pages of their love story, a pivotal moment emerged—the Festival Event at their college. S and C found themselves basking in stolen moments of intimacy, their connection growing deeper with each passing day. It was then that fate intervened, in the form of urgent calls summoning them to the top of the Computer Building.

Perplexed yet concerned, S and C ascended the stairs, anticipation mingled with fear. The voice on the other end of the line delivered news that shattered their world: C's little sister had been taken hostage. S clenched his fists, his resolve strengthening as he vowed, _"I will save her, no matter the cost."_

In a heartbeat, S leaped from the third floor, defying the limitations of flesh and bone. Pain seared through his foot upon landing, but he pressed on, driven by love's unwavering determination. The Garden, their meeting point, became his battleground, a place where heroes were born.

As the flames danced around him, S rescued C's sister, his body scarred but his spirit unbroken. The fire engulfed the Garden, threatening to consume them, but they emerged, battered and bruised, yet triumphant. S had saved not only C's sister but also their love from the clutches of despair.

In the aftermath of the festival, S stood amidst the gathered crowd, remnants of fire smoldering behind him. The once-familiar faces now regarded him with suspicion and accusation. Rumors whispered through the air, tarnishing his name, as shadows cast doubt upon his heroic act.

_"Betrayal wears many masks,"_ he penned, capturing the anguish that unfolded before him. C, torn between loyalty and uncertainty, confronted S, her eyes brimming with tears. _"How could you?"_ she cried, her voice laden with accusations, blaming him for her sister's plight.

S's heart shattered into a million fragments, each piece aching with the weight of lost love. He pleaded his innocence, his words echoing through the silence, but doubt had already taken root in C's heart. She turned away, her footsteps faltering as she walked away, leaving S alone, abandoned by the only anchor he had.

The wounds of betrayal ran deep, and S made a decision that would alter the course of his life forever. With a heavy heart, he left behind the college, the memories, and the shattered fragments of his dreams, vowing never to return.

Years slipped by, and time painted a veneer of nostalgia on S's soul. In a twist of fate, he found himself reconnecting with old friends, reminiscing about the days when hope and love still coursed through their veins. Among them was a friend who, with a gentle smile, whispered the name "C," resurrecting a bittersweet memory. In a twist of fate, a simple voice call turned into a video call. Five years had transformed C into a stunning woman, radiating beauty and confidence. S was captivated by her appearance—her jeans overcoat, goggles, violet lipstick, and enchanting gaze.

Curiosity mingled with trepidation, S dialed her number, his heart pounding in his chest. Through the pixels on the screen, he beheld a transformed C, radiating beauty and strength. "Time has been kind to you," he murmured, awestruck by the sight before him.

S mustered the courage to apologize, his voice filled with remorse. To his surprise, C's voice carried forgiveness, like a soothing balm to his wounded soul. But then, with a teasing tone, he asked the question that haunted him, **_"Will you marry me?"_**

A mischievous smile danced on C's lips, her eyes alight with playful mischief. **_"No,"_** she replied, savoring the moment, relishing in the power she held over his heart. S's world shattered once more, tears streaming down his face, believing that her love had vanished.

**_"Does your heart belong to another now?"_** he asked, his voice quivering, hoping against hope for a different answer.

C's eyes sparkled, a glimmer of mischief mingled with affection. With a dramatic pause, she replied, **_"Yes."_**

S's tears flowed freely, his heartache magnified by her response. In that moment, his dreams lay in tatters, a cruel reminder that love's path is paved with both joy and sorrow.
