# Part 3 : The Love Rekindeled

As the phone call ends, a decision is made. C, torn between love and doubt, chooses to meet S face-to-face at the **_"T's Hotel,"_** a place where their love was first ignited. It holds sentimental value, reminding them of the joy they once shared. Nervously, they step into the familiar surroundings, filled with both anticipation and trepidation.

S, his heart heavy with remorse, takes a deep breath and looks into C's eyes. _"I can't change the past, C, but I want you to know that every day without you was torture. The rumors, the judgmentâ€”it all broke me. I didn't have the strength to face you, to see the pain in your eyes because of what they said about me and your sister."_

C, her eyes brimming with a mixture of anger and hurt, replies, _"But you left me in the dark, S. I needed you, and you were nowhere to be found. Why didn't you talk to me? Why didn't you trust me enough to share the truth?"_

S's voice quivers with regret as he reaches out to gently hold C's hands. _"I was a fool, C. I was consumed by my own shame and the fear of losing you. I thought if I stayed away, the rumors would die down, and you could move on without being burdened by my tainted reputation."_

C's anger softens, replaced by a flicker of understanding. She searches S's eyes, wanting to believe his words. _"But all these years, I battled between my love for you and the doubts that haunted me. I questioned what happened that night, why I was so sleepy, and if you were capable of such actions. It tore me apart, S."_

S's voice quivers with emotion as he replies, _"C, I swear to you, there was never a moment when I disrespected or harmed your sister. The accusations were born out of lies and malicious intent. I can't change the past, but I can promise you that my love for you has always been pure and unwavering."_

Tears stream down C's cheeks as she feels the weight of S's words. She takes a deep breath, her voice filled with a mix of vulnerability and longing. _"I want to believe you, S. I want to rebuild what we had, but the doubts still linger. Help me understand, help me heal."_

S, his voice filled with sincerity, reaches out to gently wipe away C's tears. _"C, I am here now, laying my heart bare before you. I can't undo the pain we've endured, but I promise to be open, to communicate, and to fight for our love every step of the way. Together, we can heal the wounds of the past and create a future filled with trust and understanding."_

C, her heart softening, leans closer to S. _"I need time, S, to process everything, to find my way back to you. But I want you to know that deep down, my love for you never truly wavered. Let's take this journey together, rebuilding our trust, brick by brick."_

S's face lights up with a mixture of relief and hope. _"I will wait for you, C, for as long as it takes. Our love is worth fighting for. Let's make a promise to each other, here and now, that we will never let doubt or outside forces come between us again."_

And so, with their hearts mended and their love rekindled, S and C walk hand in hand out of the hotel, ready to face the future with renewed hope and commitment.

The end.
