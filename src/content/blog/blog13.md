Diary Entry - 05112023

Dear Sabrina,

Today was an extraordinary day, a day filled with moments that felt like they were plucked right out of a heartwarming anime like "Your Name," "A Silent Voice," or "Suzume." My heart swells with a mixture of excitement and uncertainty as I recount the events of the day.

The day began with a mix of anticipation and nervousness. I was about to meet N, my junior from school, after a gap of 5-6 years. We had never spoken formally back in school, but there was always something fascinating about her that had left a lasting impression on me. I remembered her as the young girl with a small face, framed spectacles, a traditional tikka on her forehead, her double-braided hair, and that infectious smile she carried. It was as if time had stood still as I awaited our long-anticipated reunion.

Our meeting took us to Shaniwar Wada for sightseeing, an experience that could rival scenes from "Your Name." The history and beauty of the place mirrored the depth of our connection, and as we explored its corridors and gardens, I couldn't help but feel a unique connection with N. We spent a lot of time talking about our lives and getting to know each other better, slowly breaking the ice that had separated us for years.

As we concluded our sightseeing, we had brunch at a nearby food corner, savoring the local delicacies that felt straight out of a scene from "Suzume," where the smallest moments hold so much meaning. Conversation flowed effortlessly between us, and it became apparent that N was genuinely interested in getting to know me, just as much as I was in getting to know her.

The day took an unexpected turn when, during our return, she grabbed my hand and leaned her head on my shoulder. The moment felt like it was straight out of "A Silent Voice," where two souls find solace in each other's presence. Her warm gesture left me both elated and bewildered, unsure of what it meant.

As the day neared its end, I mustered the courage to confess to N that she had been my school crush. It was a moment of vulnerability, and I worried that I might have rushed things. Her reaction, however, was surprising. She consoled me, appreciating my honesty, and, in a way, it was like a scene from "Your Name," where characters share their deepest feelings.

In our evening discussion, I asked N about her views on relationships, and she expressed that she wasn't ready for one, wanting to take things slow. But the most beautiful part of it all was when she asked for a friendship, similar to how characters in these anime films often cherish the bond they build before love blossoms.

Today was a rollercoaster of emotions, from nervousness and excitement to vulnerability and relief. It was a day that felt like an intricate blend of anime plotlines and real-life emotions, where the small details held immense significance. I am fully committed to nurturing this friendship and hopefully, with time, winning her heart, just like the heartwarming stories I've drawn inspiration from. It truly was a lovely day, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes us.

Yours sincerely,
Samael.
