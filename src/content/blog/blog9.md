Title: Trust and Deception: The Painful Realities of Love

When it comes to love and relationships, trust is a vital component that underpins everything. Without trust, even the strongest bond can crumble and fall apart. Unfortunately, trust is not always a given, and sometimes, it can be broken in the most painful ways.

Such was the case for one young man who had been in a relationship with his girlfriend for three months. He had gone out of his way to make her happy, even sacrificing his own well-being for her sake. But one fateful night, everything changed.

He and his girlfriend were in Mumbai, and when they reached Vasai, she received a call from her ex-boyfriend offering to pick her up. The young man thought it was okay, given that it was late at night and dangerous for a girl to travel alone. However, his girlfriend refused his help.

When they arrived at Virar, the young man thought it was his duty to catch the train for her to Palghar. She claimed she was talking to her father, who was in the Railway Police. However, he noticed her ex-boyfriend's name on the call display, and after booking her a ticket, he realized that she had been talking to her ex-boyfriend for almost more than five minutes. To make matters worse, she then took him to meet her ex-boyfriend.

The young man was devastated. He had trusted his girlfriend, and she had deceived him. She had planned to deceive him by acting like a traditional Indian wife, talking to her ex-boyfriend in a tone of respect similar to how she would talk to her father. Behind his back, she had called her ex-boyfriend to escort her, even though she had told him she was going alone. To make matters worse, she had once told him that her ex-boyfriend would call her whenever he needed personal sexual favors.

It was a painful realization for the young man. He had been deceived and betrayed, and he was struggling to come to terms with it. He felt like he had been born in the wrong time, and that there was no one he could trust. He even questioned whether he deserved anyone's love or affection, believing that he had nothing special to offer.

In moments like these, it is easy to lose faith in love and relationships. It is easy to close yourself off from the world and let the pain consume you. However, it is important to remember that trust and deception are not unique to romantic relationships. They are part of the human experience, and they can happen in any type of relationship, whether it be with family, friends, or colleagues.

The young man's situation also calls to mind a theme from Naruto, a popular Japanese anime and manga series. The show's protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, is someone who has experienced a great deal of pain and loss in his life, yet he never gives up. He always finds the strength to keep going, even when it seems like the world is against him.

One of Naruto's most famous quotes is, "Believe it!" It is a reminder to never lose faith in yourself or others, to always trust that things will work out in the end. It is a message that the young man in our story could take to heart.

Yes, he has been hurt and betrayed, but that does not mean he should give up on love altogether. 

It is important to note that everyone has their own set of values and boundaries in a relationship. For this person, trust is the foundation of any relationship and without it, they cannot continue to love and be with their partner. It is heartbreaking to see that their partner has betrayed their trust and has been dishonest with them.

The writer also mentions feeling like they were born in the wrong time. This is a common feeling among people who feel like they don't fit in with the current society or culture. It can be difficult to find a place where you feel like you belong, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own journey and path in life.

The writer also talks about feeling like they don't deserve anyone and that everyone close to them is pushing them away. This could be a result of low self-esteem or a lack of confidence. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique qualities and traits that make them special and worthy of love and respect.

In the end, the writer wonders if they should just let nobody near them and live a life of solitude. While it's understandable to feel this way after experiencing betrayal and disappointment, it's important to remember that there are good people out there who can bring joy and happiness into our lives.

To tie in the reference to Naruto, it's important to remember the lesson of perseverance and never giving up. Naruto faced many challenges and obstacles in his life, but he never gave up on his dreams and continued to push forward despite the odds. Similarly, the writer should never give up on finding happiness and love in their life, even if they have faced challenges and setbacks.

In conclusion, relationships are complex and require trust, honesty, and communication to thrive. It's important to set boundaries and values for oneself and to never compromise on them. While it can be difficult to navigate through the ups and downs of relationships, it's important to remember that there is always hope for a better future. As Naruto once said, "When people get hurt, they learn to hate...when people hurt others, they become hated and racked with guilt. But knowing that pain allows people to be kind. Pain allows people to grow...and how you grow is up to you."

## a word of Frindship
Despite all the challenges and difficulties that the young man faced in his life, he knew that there was one person he could always count on. This person was his best friend, whom he had known since childhood. The two of them had been through thick and thin together, and there was no one in the world who understood the young man's struggles better than his friend. They would talk for hours about their dreams and aspirations, and the young man always felt better after confiding in his friend. He knew that no matter what happened in life, he could always turn to his friend for support and encouragement. And that, he thought, was one of the greatest blessings in the world.
