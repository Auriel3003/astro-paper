Part 2: The Echoes of Doubt

C, left broken and confused by the events that unfolded after S's departure, had endured years of torment and self-doubt. The rumors that tainted S's name had cast a dark shadow over their once-cherished love. Night after night, she wrestled with the haunting questions that plagued her thoughts.

_"Why was I so sleepy that night?"_ she questioned, her mind a battleground of conflicting emotions. Did S truly do something wrong? Or was it a fabrication of the whispers that poisoned her mind? The uncertainty gnawed at her, tearing her apart from within.

In the wake of their shattered love, C had sought solace in her career, channeling her pain into building a successful and illustrious future. She had risen to prominence, her name known and respected in her chosen field. But despite her achievements, there was an emptiness that no accolade could fill.

Then, one fateful day, the phone rang, its unknown number jolting her from her reverie. A voice, laden with love and familiarity, called out her name, igniting a fire within her heart. It was S, reaching out after all these years, his affection pouring through the receiver.

C was overcome with a flood of emotions. She yearned to cry, to release the pent-up feelings that had consumed her in S's absence. She longed to embrace him, to kiss him, to unleash the whirlwind of emotions that had been suppressed for so long. In that moment, it felt as if all their shared memories came rushing back in an instantâ€”their joyous college days, their deep bond, and so much more.

But intertwined with those cherished memories, the haunting image of that fateful night resurfaced, casting a shadow over their conversation. C listened intently to S's words, his voice filled with love and vulnerability. He poured his heart out, sharing the pain and struggles he had endured in his absence.

As their conversation continued, C found the courage to voice her doubts, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and longing. "What happened that night?" she asked, her words laced with the echoes of uncertainty.

S's response was filled with sincerity and remorse. He recounted the events of that night, his voice carrying the weight of his innocence and the injustice he had faced. He assured her of his love, his unwavering commitment, and his desire to rebuild what had been shattered.

Yet, despite his earnest words, C's heart remained conflicted. Doubt still lingered, clouding her judgment and keeping her from fully embracing the truth. She yearned for closure, for a resolution to the unanswered questions that had tormented her for so long.
